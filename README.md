# MIT 6.S191 – Introduction to Deep Learning

This repository documents my self-directed completion of the MIT course  
**6.S191 – Introduction to Deep Learning (IAP 2025)**.

## Repository Structure

**labs/**  
Completed lab notebooks with my solutions, experiments, and observations.

**notes/**  
Short, distilled notes written in my own words. Focus on understanding rather than transcription.

**projects/**  
Small independent experiments inspired by the course. Used to explore ideas beyond the official labs.

**source/mit/**  
Unmodified original course materials from MIT (kept for reference and attribution).

## Learning Approach

For each lab:

1. Study the original material from MIT.
2. Re-implement and complete the notebook independently.
3. Write short notes capturing key ideas and insights.
4. Run small experiments to deepen understanding.
5. Commit progress incrementally to maintain a transparent learning record.

## Source & Attribution

Course materials are based on:

MIT 6.S191 – Introduction to Deep Learning (IAP 2020)  
MITDeepLearning/introtodeeplearning GitHub repository

Original files are preserved under `source/mit/`.  
All work in `labs/`, `notes/`, and `projects/` reflects my own study and experimentation.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A public record of my deep learning study
- A technical learning log
- A foundation for future machine learning and AI projects
